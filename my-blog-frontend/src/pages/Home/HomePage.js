                    Welcome to my first Blog Post. YAY!
                    I am so ready to have a place to share all my travels on, and share my life with you!

                    I’m Shobith Chandran K, from India. But I’ve lived in Budapest, Germany, and the US before! I don’t know,
                    I just never felt like “home” in a specific country.
                    Is that just me or do you also never really know the answer to the question where you’re from?
                    So like I have a Swiss passport, but lived at the German border, 
                    so I don’t really speak Swiss German, but my parents are from India, 
                    so I grew up Indian. Oh, and I’ve also lived abroad in the States.

                    This is a travel blog. Ok, it’s not just that.
                    I want to share my life experiences, the best things, and also the negative sites, of each my travels. 
                    About studying abroad. About online schooling and college, and how to build your own business and make money as a student!
